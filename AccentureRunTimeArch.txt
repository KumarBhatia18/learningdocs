In the Cube, the Runtime Architecture defines Architecture Capabilities that support the Runtime of an application
e.g. Logging, Caching, Guaranteed Delivery, Encryption and
that will be implemented by Components, typically at the Infrastructure or Platform layer (but sometimes programmatically at the Application Layer).
Runtime Architecture Capabilities can be described as a collection of the technical capabilities within the system itself that support key business requirements:
support the Functional Application, meeting the functional requirements and
meet the Technical Requirements, addressing Architecture Concerns and related -illities.


Functional RunTime Capabilities
Technical Runtime Capabilities
Presentation Capabilities
Security Capabilities
Business Processing Logic Capabilities
Data Management Capabilities
Caching Capabilities


When defining the Runtime Architecture requirements, always take into consideration the “-ilities”:
availability, performance, scalability, reliability, extensibility, reusability, interoperability, portability, maturity, and security
